    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A no bake option that is better than a stovetop box mix</p>
    <p>This recipe utilizes the stovetop and has fewer servings which is great for couples or small families.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb. of ground beef</li>
        <li>14 oz. of spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can of diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of dried basil (optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of dried oregano (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups of dried malfada noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzerella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
